        <strong>Anxiety and Depression Crisis: What It Is and Symptoms</strong>
        <strong>UNDERSTAND IN SUMMARY</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        An anxiety crisis, also known as a panic attack or panic crisis, is a
        sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort that peaks quickly and is
        accompanied by a series of physical and emotional symptoms. These crises
        can occur unexpectedly and are often very frightening, even though they
        do not represent a real danger.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Symptoms of an Anxiety Crisis:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Palpitations or increased heart rate</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
        <li>Excessive sweating</li>
        <li>Tremors or shaking</li>
        <li>Feeling of choking</li>
        <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
        <li>Nausea or abdominal discomfort</li>
        <li>Dizziness, vertigo, or feeling faint</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These symptoms can last from a few minutes to about half an hour, but
        the emotional impact can last much longer.

      <h2>During an Anxiety Crisis: Steps to Alleviate Symptoms</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Controlled Breathing:</strong> Breathe slowly and deeply:
          Inhale through your nose counting to four, hold your breath for four
          seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth counting to four.
          This helps calm the nervous system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus on Something Physical:</strong> Hold an object and focus
          on its details. This helps divert attention from anxious thoughts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong> Observe what is happening
          around you without judgment, focusing on sounds, colors, or physical
          sensations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Positive Affirmations:</strong> Repeat reassuring phrases like
          "This will pass" or "I am safe."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Move:</strong> Simple movements like walking or stretching
          help dissipate anxious energy and reduce tension.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2><strong>What Is a Depressive Crisis?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        A depressive crisis is an intense period of worsening depression
        symptoms. During this crisis, a person may feel deep sadness,
        hopelessness, lack of energy, and loss of interest in activities that
        were once pleasurable. These feelings may be accompanied by intense
        negative thoughts, and in severe cases, suicidal thoughts may arise.
