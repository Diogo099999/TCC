        <h2>1. Genetic Factors</h2>
        <p>
          Anxiety can run in families, and individuals with a family history of
          anxiety may have an increased likelihood of experiencing it
          themselves. Genetics can influence how our bodies respond to stress.

      <div class="cause-block">
        <h2>2. Environmental Stressors and Trauma</h2>
        <p>
          Exposure to stressful or traumatic events, such as work pressure,
          family conflict, or past trauma, can contribute to anxiety. These
          experiences can leave lasting effects on mental health, increasing
          susceptibility to anxiety.

      <div class="cause-block">
        <h2>3. Imbalances in Brain Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          Anxiety is often associated with imbalances in neurotransmitters,
          chemicals that regulate mood and stress. These imbalances can make it
          difficult to cope with stress, leading to feelings of anxiety.
