        <h2>1. Genetic Factors</h2>
        <p>
          Individuals with a family history of depression may have a higher risk
          of developing the condition themselves. Studies suggest that genetics
          can influence the way our brains respond to stress and manage
          mood-regulating chemicals.

        <h2>2. Chronic Stress and Trauma</h2>
        <p>
          Long-term exposure to stressful situations, such as work pressure,
          family conflict, or past trauma, can lead to depression. Chronic
          stress affects the brain’s structure and chemistry, potentially making
          it harder to regulate emotions effectively.

      <div class="cause-block">
        <h2>3. Chemical Imbalances in the Brain</h2>
        <p>
          Depression is often linked to imbalances in neurotransmitters, which
          are chemicals that help control mood and emotion. These imbalances can
          make it challenging for individuals to manage stress and may lead to
          depressive symptoms over time.
